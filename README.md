# Projects1 

Each directory has it's own corresponding README with greater detail. <br>
Note that all the projects listed in this repository are implemented in Python. <br>

**BFS, Breadth-First-Search:** <br>
 
The Breadth-first-search algorithm is a method for finding the shortest path to a specific node in the graph. This construct was applied to the IMDB dataset to find connections between actors. Not only did I implement a graph class from scratch, but also used the NetworkX library. <br>

**Binary_Trees:** <br>

I implemented a class that represents a binary tree. I compared the benefits of this data structure to singly-linked-lists, and a "AVL" or balanced binary tree. <br>

**Conditional_Stability:** <br> 



**Differentiation:** <br>

**Drazin:** <br>

**KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor):** <br>

**Markov_Chains:** <br>

Markov Chains are valuable for making prediction given initial condiitons and probabilities for transitioning from one state to another. Among several applications, these concepts can be applied to transitioning from one word to another in the english language - which results in humorous language generation. <br>

**Monte_carlo:** <br>

**Newtons_methods:** <br>

**PageRank:** <br>

**Unit_testing:** <br>
