Each directory has it's own corresponding README with greater detail <br>
Note that all the projects listed in this repository are implemented in Python <br>

**BFS, Breadth-First-Search:** <br>
 
I implemented a class that represents a binary tree. The Breadth-first-search algorithm is a method for finding the shortest path to a specific node in the graph. This construct was applied to the IMDB dataset to find connections between actors. <br>

**Binary_Trees:** <br>

**Conditional_Stability:** <br>

**Differentiation:** <br>

**Drazin:** <br>

**KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor):** <br>

**Markov_Chains:** <br>

**Monte_carlo:** <br>

**Newtons_methods:** <br>

**PageRank:** <br>
