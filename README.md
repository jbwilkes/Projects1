# Projects1 

Each directory will have it's own corresponding README with greater detail. <br>
Note that all the projects listed in this repository are implemented in Python. <br>
[Several of these projects utilize graph theory - see this link for a brief intro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)

**BFS, Breadth-First-Search:** <br>
 
The Breadth-first-search algorithm is a method for finding the shortest path to a specific node in the graph. This construct was applied to the IMDB dataset to find connections between actors. Not only did I implement a graph class from scratch, but also used the NetworkX library. <br>

**Binary_Trees:** <br>

I implemented a class that represents a binary tree. I compared the benefits of this data structure to singly-linked-lists, and an "AVL" or balanced binary tree. <br>

**Conditional_Stability:** <br> 



**Differentiation:** <br>

**Drazin:** <br> 

The Drazin inverse is a matrix (pseudo-inverse) that encapsulates the connectivity between nodes in an undirected graph. This lab simulates "friend" recommendation/prediction in social media. 

**KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor):** <br>

**Markov_Chains:** <br>

Markov Chains are valuable for making prediction given initial condiitons and probabilities for transitioning from one state to another. Among several applications, these concepts can be applied to transitioning from one word to another in the english language - which results in humorous language generation. <br>

**Monte_carlo:** <br>

**Newtons_methods:** <br>

**PageRank:** <br> The PageRank algorithm is the birthplace of the Google search engine. It provides a way to denote the importance of nodes in a directed graph (like the importance of webpages on the internet). 

**Unit_testing:** <br> This project demonstrates the beneficial practice of building test cases for code. These test cases can be used to validate changes in a program.
